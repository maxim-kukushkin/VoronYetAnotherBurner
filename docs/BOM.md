## Below is the list of the components and tools that are needed to build the toolhead

### Devices
- Dragon High Flow hotend
- BondTech LGX Lite extruder
- 2x 5015 blower fans
- 6x ws2812b RGB LEDs
- (optional) ADXL345 accelerometer
- (optional, but recommended) LDO toolhead breakout PCB

### Screws (allen cap head)
- 2x M2x6

- 4x M2.5x16

- 6x M3x6
- 4x M3x8
- 6x M3x12
- 2x M3x16
- 6x M3x20
- 2x M3x30
- 2x M3x50

- 2x M4x20

### Washers
- 2x M3 (in theory, optional)

### Heatset inserts
- 2x M2x3.5x3.5 (or M2x3.5x3)
- 22x M3x5x4
- 2x M4x6x4

### Other
- PTFE tube (~2cm, to use between the extruder and the hotend)
- Bowden tube (to guide the filament into the extruder
- 3x awg 26-30 wires, preferably different colors, ~50cm each (better to have some extra) (for LEDs)
- Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 male (this is what LDO kits use, it may vary based on when LED connector is already being used in the printer)

### Tools
- Soldering iron + solder
- PETG filament (normal color, accent color and transparent filament). Option to use ABS, but it hasn't been tested with the STLs/models included in this repo
- (optional) soldering iron adaptor for heatset inserts
- A crimping tool would come in handy when working with the Molex Micro-Fit connector
- A screwdriver for M2, M2.5, M3 and M4 allen keys
